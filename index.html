            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I work as a Digital Operations Support Coordinator at Kohl's Corporate Headquarters in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. I have an eclectic background with experience in both apparel product developement & SEO copy-writing before joining Digital Operations. I have a great passion for embracing diverse perspectives & ensuring everyone can bring their authentic selves to work. This has led to my most recent success at Kohl's, where I lead the Digital Diversity & Inclusion Task Force. I oversee five Chairs who collectively manage four committees dedicated to advancing diversity & inclusion for our associates, our customers, and our community. I am currently pursuing a Full Stack Web Development certification through the University of Minnesota.

                Meditation helps me slow my mind & focus on the present moment. It allows me to gravitate towards the more important, more valuable things in life. To anyone who's at all interested, go for it. I have a feeling you'll love it!

                "Between the pages of a book is a lovely place to be." -Anonymous. I very much agree with whomever quoted these words. I love being transported into a whole other world by reading. I'm definitely a big fan of thrillers & suspense.

            <p>
                To me there's nothing better than gathering with friends & enjoying an ice cold drink. Whether an upscale city-based restaurant or a dive bar that only accepts cash, I am just happy to be around the people who make life worth living.
